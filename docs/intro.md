# Welcome to BurgerAPI

BurgerAPI is a modern, open-source framework built natively for Bun.js. It simplifies building web applications and APIs with features designed for speed and ease of use.

:::tip What makes BurgerAPI special?

BurgerAPI leverages Bun's speed and offers a streamlined development experience through:

- **Declarative File-Based Routing:** Define API endpoints and static pages simply by organizing your files and folders.
- **Integrated Middleware:** Apply logic globally or target specific routes for concerns like logging, authentication, and data processing.
- **Automatic Zod Validation:** Define Zod schemas alongside your routes for effortless request validation (query parameters and request bodies). Now powered by Zod 4.x for enhanced performance and better error handling.
- **OpenAPI Specification & Swagger UI:** Automatically generate OpenAPI 3.0 documentation from your code (including Zod schemas and route metadata) and serve interactive Swagger UI.
- **TypeScript First:** Designed with TypeScript for improved developer experience and code safety.

:::

This documentation provides guides on using these core features based on the framework's implementation.
